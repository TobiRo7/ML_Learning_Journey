# From Dataset to a Finished Machine Learning Model
1.	**Data Acquisition** - Import and convert data into a pandas DataFrame: 
This step involves loading data from a source (e.g., CSV file, database) and saving it in a pandas DataFrame. You can also import necessary libraries to work with the data.
2.	**Data Cleaning** - Remove irrelevant data and format data if necessary: 
Identify and remove irrelevant or redundant columns that are not relevant to the model. Format the data to ensure it is suitable for modeling. This may include cleaning NaN values, unifying data types, and removing duplicates, spaces, or special characters.
3.	**Exploratory Data Analysis** - Examine data, especially column names: 
After importing the data, it's important to take an initial look at the data. Review the first rows of the DataFrame to understand the data structure and column names. Analyze the data to gain a better understanding of its distribution, patterns, and relationships between variables. This can be done through visualizations and statistical analyses.
4.	**Feature Engineering** - Define features and targets, consider data leakage: 
Determine the features (independent variables) to be used in the model and the target (dependent variable) to be predicted. Ensure that no information from the future (data leakage) is used in the training process. In this step, new features are created from existing data or existing features are transformed to better align the model with the task. This may involve creating categorical variables, scaling features, or extracting relevant information.
5.	**Data Split:**
The data is divided into training data, validation data, and test data. Typically, most of the data is used for training the model, a smaller portion for validation to select the model, and an independent test dataset for the final evaluation.
6.	**Model Selection:** 
In this step, you choose the appropriate machine learning model that best suits the task. This can vary depending on the task and data, such as linear models, decision trees, neural networks, etc.
7.	**Model Training:** 
The selected model is trained on the training data by learning the relationships between the features and the target value. This may involve tuning model parameters and performing cross-validation.
8.	**Model Evaluation:** 
The trained model is tested on the validation data to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), Mean Absolute Error, etc., are used to evaluate model performance.
9.	**Model Fine-Tuning:** 
Based on the results of model evaluation, adjustments to model parameters can be made to improve performance. This step can be iterative.
10.	**Final Model Evaluation:** 
Once the model is optimized, it is tested on the independent test dataset to evaluate its performance in a real-world environment and ensure it generalizes well.
11.	**Model Deployment:**
Finally, the trained and tested model is deployed in a production environment where it can be used for predictions on new data.
12.	**Monitoring and Maintenance:** 
After deployment, the model is monitored and maintained to ensure it continues to make accurate predictions and meets changing requirements.

In addition to these steps, it's important to regularly review and optimize to ensure the model makes accurate predictions and operates efficiently. This may also include the use of cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and other advanced techniques.

**Data Pipeline:** 
Create a data pipeline that combines preprocessing steps like feature scaling, feature engineering, and model selection into a single step. This helps make the code more organized and maintainable. Using a pipeline allows for seamless automation and organization of these steps, improving code reusability and efficiency in model development. This is particularly important in complex projects where multiple data processing and modeling steps are required.
