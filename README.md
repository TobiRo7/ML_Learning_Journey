## Introduction
My name is Tobi and here I provide the documentation about my ongoing progress in the field of data science and machine learning (ML). <br>
Based on this [ML-Study-Guide from Patrick Loeber](https://github.com/AssemblyAI-Examples/ML-Study-Guide), I am studying this topic to qualify for a future job as a bioinformatician in about 3 to 5 years, if my interest is not snatched away by another field like process engineering or biotech projects. The guide recommends learning the mathematical basics first, then going over to programming with Python and the most important Python packages before actually studying machine learning. After that, it advises to practice the learned contents on the free-to-use online study page [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). <br>
Khan Academy and ChatGPT are really helpful with repeating and teaching the fundamental math behind machine learning. As I already have done some programming in Python before discovering machine learning, I will skip the basic Python courses and immerse myself directly into the relevant Python packages for data analysis and visualization. At the moment, I am not planning to do Andrew Ng's ML course because I watched and practiced along the first 19 tutorials of [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfKTOs3Keq_kaG2P55YRn5v). But I might be coming back to this option later. <br>
Quick summary: I am studying math, programming with Python and doing practical courses and projects to get proficient in machine learning.
